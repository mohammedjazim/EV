Abstract-Vehicular emissions have major impact on global warming. Many countries have had serious considerations about it and have delved into developing alternative fuel technologies. The most optimistic choice for powering electric vehicles at present and the immediate future is battery electric power. The global automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in research of battery run efficient electric vehicles. This paper demonstrates step-by-step mathematical calculations and simulation modeling of Electric Vehicle (EV). In this paper, EV namely "Mahindra e20" from a leading automobile manufacturer of India, Mahindra & Mahindra has been simulated and analyzed in MATLAB /Simulink platform. The simulation model is equipped with recuperation capability of EV. Its performance has been investigated by simulation results for various vehicle velocity inputs and summarized in terms of vehicle range and Battery State of Charge (SOC). Furthermore, vehicle range and SOC are evaluated and summarized with variation of input parameters at the end of this paper. This summary can give significant insight to improve the range of this EV. This paper is developed in such a way that it can act as ready reference for the design, simulation and analysis of EV.
