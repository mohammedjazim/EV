Abstract-Vehicular emissions have major impact on global warming. Many countries have had serious considerations about it and have delved into developing alternative fuel technologies. The most optimistic choice for powering electric vehicles at present and the immediate future is battery electric power. The global automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in research of battery run efficient electric vehicles. This work demonstrates step-by-step mathematical calculations and simulation modeling of Electric Vehicle (EV).
